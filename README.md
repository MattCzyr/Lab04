# Project

Our project is an extension for Visiual Studio Code that simply runs in the
background and harvests your data, such as your search history, browsing
history, and even the code that you write.

# Business Model

After harvesting the users' data, we sell it to FaceBook.

# License
The Apache Lisence was chosen due to its in depth desription of its terms. The other appealing aspects of the Apache license is that any changes to licensed material must be documented and that it does not grant trademark use. This gives it slightly more value for our business model rather than the MIT lisence. So in the event that someone just forks the prject, they are responsible to note any changes as to further distance them from us if they decide to do anything malicious.
