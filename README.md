# Project

Our project is an extension for Visual Studio Code that simply runs in the
background and harvests your data, such as your search history, browsing
history, and even the code that you write.

# Business Model

After harvesting the users' data, we sell it to FaceBook.

# License
We chose the Apache Lisence because it offers an in-depth description of its
terms. Other appealing aspects of the Apache license are that any changes to
licensed material must be documented, and that it does not grant trademark use.
This makes it slightly more valuable to us and our business model over the MIT
license. In the event that someone forks our project, they are responsible to
note any changes as to further distance their work from ours in case they use
it for something malicious.
